  <h1>srh.pet </h1>
  <p>once upon a time, there was a creature</p>
  <p>this creature was called sarah</p>
  <p>sarah wasn't quite sure what it was, but it knew it wasn't human. well, not just human anyway</p>
  <p>after years of experimentation and self-discovery, it came to realise something</p>
  <p>it didn't want to be human. it didn't like being human. thoughts were too hard, human traditions too much</p>
  <p>slowly, over time, it started acting like a girl.</p>
  <p>and then started expressing puppy-like traits<p>
  <p>sarah was a girl and a dog. a puppygirl</p>
  <p>sarah was a pet, with an owner</p>
